# OOP Concepts - c#

This repository contains a C# project developed as part of my internship assignment. The project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and demonstrates concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

**Key Features:**
- Abstract base class for users with derived classes for staff and readers.
- Implementation of a simple library management system with books, users, and transactions.
- Usage of static members, interfaces, and various OOP design patterns.

**Note:**
This project was created as an assignment during my internship to showcase proficiency in C# programming and OOP principles.
